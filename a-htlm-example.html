<H3>What is Coxinha?</H3>
<P>Warm, crispy, golden-brown croquette shaped like a little teardrop, stuffed with seasoned shredded chicken and, if you’re lucky, a touch of creamy cheese. It’s the kind of snack that makes you forget everything else for a moment. In Brazil, Coxinha is the go-to treat for parties, family gatherings, or just because you need something amazing to munch on.

    The story goes that Coxinha was born in São Paulo, created for a young Brazilian Prince who adored chicken thighs. The name itself, coxinha, literally means “little thigh,” which is why it’s shaped the way it is. But whether or not you buy into the royal origin tale, one thing’s for sure: Coxinha has become a beloved classic, loved by everyone from kids to grandparents.

    And here’s the thing—it’s more than just food. It’s that comforting taste that reminds you of home, friends, and all the times you gathered around a plate of freshly fried Coxinhas, trying not to burn your mouth because you just couldn’t wait.</P>

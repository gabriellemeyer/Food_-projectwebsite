<h2>What is Coxinha?</h2>
<P>Warm, crispy, golden-brown croquette shaped like a little teardrop, stuffed with seasoned shredded chicken and, if you’re lucky, a touch of creamy cheese. It’s the kind of snack that makes you forget everything else for a moment. In Brazil, Coxinha is the go-to treat for parties, family gatherings, or just because you need something amazing to munch on.

    The story goes that Coxinha was born in São Paulo, created for a young Brazilian Prince who adored chicken thighs. The name itself, coxinha, literally means “little thigh,” which is why it’s shaped the way it is. But whether or not you buy into the royal origin tale, one thing’s for sure: Coxinha has become a beloved classic, loved by everyone from kids to grandparents.

    And here’s the thing—it’s more than just food. It’s that comforting taste that reminds you of home, friends, and all the times you gathered around a plate of freshly fried Coxinhas, trying not to burn your mouth because you just couldn’t wait.</P>

<h2>How to Make Coxinha:</h2>
Alright, let’s break down how to make Coxinha at home. It’s not difficult, but it does need some attention to detail. Trust me, once you get the hang of it, you’ll be cranking these out like you were born to do it.

<h3>1. Make the Filling</h3>
First up is the filling. Everything needs to be finely chopped and shredded. Why? Because there’s nothing worse than biting into a big chunk of onion when you’re expecting a perfectly balanced bite. Plus, those big pieces hog space that could be used for all the good stuff. So, take your time and make sure everything is evenly chopped and well-seasoned. It’s worth it, I promise.

<strong>Pro Tip: Season your filling generously. You don’t want bland bites. You’re aiming for a filling so good you’ll have to stop yourself from eating it straight out of the bowl.</strong>

<h3>2. Make the Dough</h3>
Now, onto the dough. There are two authentic routes you can take: with or without potato. Most people wouldn’t even notice the difference, but I’m team potato. Why? It makes the dough softer and creamier on the inside, which is a perfect contrast to the crispy exterior.

<h3>3. Putting it All Together</h3>
Once your filling is ready and your dough is rolled out, it’s time to shape the coxinhas. Roll the dough into a long log, then cut it into small pieces. Flatten each piece, stuff with your filling, and roll into a teardrop shape. This is where the magic happens—your hands will get messy, but that’s part of the charm.
<h3>4. Breading and Frying</h3>
Finally, it’s time to bread and fry. Dip each coxinha in beaten eggs, then coat with breadcrumbs. Fry them in hot oil until they’re golden brown and crispy. The smell alone will have you drooling.

  <h2>Dough Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Milk:</strong> I usually use whole milk or 2% milk.

      <strong>Chicken stock/broth:</strong> I prefer store-bought, no-salt-added chicken stock. You can also use homemade stock or water. Adjust the salt if your broth is already salty.

      <strong>Butter:</strong> Either salted or unsalted works fine. I haven’t noticed a big difference in flavor.
    </li>

      <strong>Potatoes:</strong> I typically use white potatoes, but yellow or russet potatoes also work well.
